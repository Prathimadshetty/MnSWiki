While it can be convenient to test application code with hardcoded credentials during development this significantly increases risk and should be avoided. CWE-798 2 Develop a Strong Password Reset System Password reset systems are often the weakest link in an application. These systems are often based on the user answering personal questions to establish their identity and in turn reset the password. The system needs to be based on questions that are both hard to guess and brute force. Additionally, any password reset option must not reveal whether or not an account is valid, preventing username harvesting. CWE-640 3 Implement a Strong Password Policy and Move Towards Passwordless Authentication For password based authentication, password policy should be created and implemented so that passwords meet specific strength criteria. If the user base and application can support it, leverage the various forms of passwordless authentication such as FIDO2 based authentication or mobile application push based authenticators. CWE-521 4 Implement Account Lockout against Brute Force Attacks Account lockout needs to be implemented to guard against brute forcing attacks against both the authentication and password reset functionality. After several tries on a specific user account, the account should be locked for a period of time or until manually unlocked. Additionally, it is best to continue the same failure message indicating that the credentials are incorrect or the account is locked to prevent an attacker from harvesting usernames. CWE-307 5 Don't Disclose Too Much Information in Error Messages Messages for authentication errors must be clear and, at the same time, be written so that sensitive information about the system is not disclosed. For example, error messages which reveal that the userid is valid but that the corresponding password is incorrect confirms to an attacker that the account does exist on the system. . 6 Store Database Credentials and API keys Securely Modern web applications usually consist of multiple layers. The business logic tier (processing of information) often connects to the data tier (database). Connecting to the database, of course, requires authentication. The authentication credentials in the business logic tier must be stored in a centralized location that is locked down. The same applies to accessing APIs providing services to support your application. Scattering credentials throughout the source code is not acceptable. Some development frameworks provide a centralized secure location for storing credentials to the backend database. Secret management solutions that are cloud based or on-premise can be used to allow the application to acquire the credential at application launch or when needed, therefore securing the credentials and avoid storing them statically on disk within a server or a container image. CWE-257 7 Applications and Middleware Should Run with Minimal Privileges If an application becomes compromised it is important that the application itself and any middleware services be configured to run with minimal privileges. For instance, while the application layer or business layer needs the ability to read and write data to the underlying database, administrative credentials that grant access to other databases or tables should not be provided.

CWE-511 6 No sensitive data in source Verify that the application source code and third party libraries do not contain malicious code, such as salami attacks, logic bypasses, or logic bombs. CWE-511 7 No sensitive data in source Verify that the application source code and third party libraries do not contain Easter eggs or any other potentially unwanted functionality. CWE-507 8 Deployed Application Integrity Controls Verify that if the application has a client or server auto-update feature, updates should be obtained over secure channels and digitally signed. The update code must validate the digital signature of the update before installing or executing the update. CWE-16 9 Deployed Application Integrity Controls Verify that the application employs integrity protections, such as code signing or subresource integrity. The application must not load or execute code from untrusted sources, such as loading includes, modules, plugins, code, or libraries from untrusted sources or the Internet. CWE-353 10 Deployed Application Integrity Controls Verify that the application has protection from subdomain takeovers if the application relies upon DNS entries or DNS subdomains, such as expired domain names, out of date DNS pointers or CNAMEs, expired projects at public source code repos, or transient cloud APIs, serverless functions, or storage buckets (autogen-bucket-id.cloud.example.com) or similar. Protections can include ensuring that DNS names used by applications are regularly checked for expiry or change.

CWE-6 2 Regenerate Session Tokens Session tokens should be regenerated when the user authenticates to the application and when the user privilege level changes. Additionally, should the encryption status change, the session token should always be regenerated. CWE-384 3 Implement an Idle Session Timeout When a user is not active, the application should automatically log the user out. Be aware that Ajax applications may make recurring calls to the application effectively resetting the timeout counter automatically. CWE-613 4 Implement an Absolute Session Timeout Users should be logged out after an extensive amount of time (e.g. 4-8 hours) has passed since they logged in. This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker using a hijacked session. CWE-613 5 Destroy Sessions at Any Sign of Tampering Unless the application requires multiple simultaneous sessions for a single user, implement features to detect session cloning attempts. Should any sign of session cloning be detected, the session should be destroyed, forcing the real user to re-authenticate. . 6 Invalidate the Session after Logout When the user logs out of the application the session and corresponding data on the server must be destroyed. This ensures that the session can not be accidentally revived. CWE-613 7 Place a Logout Button on Every Page The logout button or logout link should be easily accessible to the user on every page after they have authenticated. . 8 Use Secure Cookie Attributes (HttpOnly, Secure and SameSite Flags) The session cookie should be set with both the HttpOnly and the Secure flags. This ensures that the session id will not be accessible to client-side scripts and it will only be transmitted over HTTPS, respectively. In addition, the SameSite attribute should be set to with either lax or straight mode to reduce the risk of Cross Site Request Forgery. CWE-79, CWE-614,CWE-1004 9 Set the Cookie Domain and Path Correctly The cookie domain and path scope should be set to the most restrictive settings for your application. Any wildcard domain scoped cookie must have a good justification for its existence. . 10 Set the Cookie Expiration Time The session cookie should have a reasonable expiration time. Non-expiring session cookies should be avoided. . ...","title":"Session Management"},{"location":"Web%20Service/","text":"... # Security Control Security Requirement CWE 1 Generic Web Service Security Verification Requirements Verify that all application components use the same encodings and parsers to avoid parsing attacks that exploit different URI or file parsing behavior that could be used in SSRF and RFI attacks.

CWE-436 11 RESTful Web Service Verification Requirements Verify that the message headers and payload are trustworthy and not modified in transit. Requiring strong encryption for transport (TLS only) may be sufficient in many cases as it provides both confidentiality and integrity protection. Per-message digital signatures can provide additional assurance on top of the transport protections for high-security applications but bring with them additional complexity and risks to weigh against the benefits. CWE-345 12 SOAP Web Service Verification Requirements Verify that XSD schema validation takes place to ensure a properly formed XML document, followed by validation of each input field before any processing of that data takes place.
