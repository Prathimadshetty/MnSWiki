CWE-477 ...","title":"Architecture"},{"location":"Authentication/","text":"... # Security Control Security Requirement CWE 1 Don't Hardcode Credentials Never allow credentials to be stored directly within the application code. While it can be convenient to test application code with hardcoded credentials during development this significantly increases risk and should be avoided. CWE-798 2 Develop a Strong Password Reset System Password reset systems are often the weakest link in an application. These systems are often based on the user answering personal questions to establish their identity and in turn reset the password. The system needs to be based on questions that are both hard to guess and brute force. Additionally, any password reset option must not reveal whether or not an account is valid, preventing username harvesting. CWE-640 3 Implement a Strong Password Policy and Move Towards Passwordless Authentication For password based authentication, password policy should be created and implemented so that passwords meet specific strength criteria. If the user base and application can support it, leverage the various forms of passwordless authentication such as FIDO2 based authentication or mobile application push based authenticators. CWE-521 4 Implement Account Lockout against Brute Force Attacks Account lockout needs to be implemented to guard against brute forcing attacks against both the authentication and password reset functionality. After several tries on a specific user account, the account should be locked for a period of time or until manually unlocked. Additionally, it is best to continue the same failure message indicating that the credentials are incorrect or the account is locked to prevent an attacker from harvesting usernames. CWE-307 5 Don't Disclose Too Much Information in Error Messages Messages for authentication errors must be clear and, at the same time, be written so that sensitive information about the system is not disclosed. For example, error messages which reveal that the userid is valid but that the corresponding password is incorrect confirms to an attacker that the account does exist on the system. . 6 Store Database Credentials and API keys Securely Modern web applications usually consist of multiple layers. The business logic tier (processing of information) often connects to the data tier (database). Connecting to the database, of course, requires authentication. The authentication credentials in the business logic tier must be stored in a centralized location that is locked down. The same applies to accessing APIs providing services to support your application. Scattering credentials throughout the source code is not acceptable. Some development frameworks provide a centralized secure location for storing credentials to the backend database. Secret management solutions that are cloud based or on-premise can be used to allow the application to acquire the credential at application launch or when needed, therefore securing the credentials and avoid storing them statically on disk within a server or a container image. CWE-257 7 Applications and Middleware Should Run with Minimal Privileges If an application becomes compromised it is important that the application itself and any middleware services be configured to run with minimal privileges. For instance, while the application layer or business layer needs the ability to read and write data to the underlying database, administrative credentials that grant access to other databases or tables should not be provided.

CWE-799 3 Business Logic Security Controls Verify the application has appropriate limits for specific business actions or transactions which are correctly enforced on a per user basis. CWE-770 4 Business Logic Security Controls Verify the application has sufficient anti-automation controls to detect and protect against data exfiltration, excessive business logic requests, excessive file uploads or denial of service attacks. CWE-770 5 Business Logic Security Controls Verify the application has business logic limits or validation to protect against likely business risks or threats, identified using threat modeling or similar methodologies.

CWE-319 3 Use the Strict-Transport-Security Header The Strict-Transport-Security header ensures that the browser does not talk to the server over HTTP. This helps reduce the risk of HTTP downgrade attacks as implemented by the sslsniff tool. . 4 Store User Passwords Using a Strong, Iterative, Salted Hash User passwords must be stored using secure hashing techniques with strong algorithms like PBKDF2, bcrypt, or SHA-512. Simply hashing the password a single time does not sufficiently protect the password. Use adaptive hashing (a work factor), combined with a randomly generated salt for each user to make the hash strong.

For older browsers that do not support this header add framebusting Javascript code to mitigate Clickjacking (although this method is not foolproof and can be circumvented). CWE-693 10 Use Secure HTTP Response Headers The Content Security Policy (CSP), X-XSS-Protection, X-Content-Type-Options headers help defend against Cross-Site Scripting(XSS) attack. In specific, CSP should be customized for the application to lock down the source and location of content plus adding logging to provide some attack detection capability on the front end. CWE-79,CWE-692 11 Deserialize Untrusted Data with Proper Controls When handling serialized data from untrusted source (or passing through untrusted paths), proper controls have to be in place to prevent attacker from abusing the automatic data structure rebuilding capability within the programming language. Each programming platform has its own mitigation strategy which range from using alternative data interchange format such as JSON to restricting the types of objects that can be deserialized. Refer to OWASP Deserialization Cheat Sheet for some great defense information.

CWE-6 2 Regenerate Session Tokens Session tokens should be regenerated when the user authenticates to the application and when the user privilege level changes. Additionally, should the encryption status change, the session token should always be regenerated. CWE-384 3 Implement an Idle Session Timeout When a user is not active, the application should automatically log the user out. Be aware that Ajax applications may make recurring calls to the application effectively resetting the timeout counter automatically. CWE-613 4 Implement an Absolute Session Timeout Users should be logged out after an extensive amount of time (e.g. 4-8 hours) has passed since they logged in. This helps mitigate the risk of an attacker using a hijacked session. CWE-613 5 Destroy Sessions at Any Sign of Tampering Unless the application requires multiple simultaneous sessions for a single user, implement features to detect session cloning attempts. Should any sign of session cloning be detected, the session should be destroyed, forcing the real user to re-authenticate. . 6 Invalidate the Session after Logout When the user logs out of the application the session and corresponding data on the server must be destroyed. This ensures that the session can not be accidentally revived. CWE-613 7 Place a Logout Button on Every Page The logout button or logout link should be easily accessible to the user on every page after they have authenticated. . 8 Use Secure Cookie Attributes (HttpOnly, Secure and SameSite Flags) The session cookie should be set with both the HttpOnly and the Secure flags.
